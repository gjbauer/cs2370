cs2370 Notes: 34 Artificial Intelligence
========================================

23 April 2024·171 words·1 min·





The most hyped computer thing this year is “AI”. We happen to have the
tools to mess with it a bit, so let’s do that.

```
pip install transformers
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio \
    --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install timm pillow

```

Answer a question:

```
from transformers import pipeline
import time
t0 = time.time()
qa = pipeline("question-answering")
context = """
My family has several pets.
We have a chicken. Her name is Virginia. We got her used, so I'm not
sure what breed she is exactly.
We have a dog. Her name is Scarlett. She is a boxer mix.
And we have a pet spider. Her name is Kiwi.
"""
question = "What is my dog's name?"
answer = qa(question=question, context=context)
t1 = time.time()
print("runtime:", round(t1-t0, 2))
print(answer)

```

Image: [some wolves](https://www.wallpaperflare.com/static/906/824/973/digital-art-wolf-moon-three-wallpaper.jpg)

```
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image
img = Image.open("/home/nat/Pictures/digital-art-wolf-moon-three-wallpaper.jpg")
od = pipeline('object-detection')
result = od(img)
print(result)

```

VQA example:

```
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image
vqa = pipeline(model="dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa")
img = Image.open("/home/nat/Pictures/digital-art-wolf-moon-three-wallpaper.jpg")
answer = vqa(question="How many wolves are there?", image=img)

```
