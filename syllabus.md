Texts

[#](#texts)
------------------

Students are not required to purchase a commercial textbook for this course.

Freely available textbooks:

* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
* [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)

Grading

[#](#grading)
======================

| Thing | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| Labs | 40 |
| Homework | 35 |
| Final Exam | 25 |

The number of points available in an assessment may (or may not)
exceed the denominator used in the grade calculation. For example, if
the final exam offers 104 points out of 100, then a perfect score
would count as 26% towards the final course grade.

**Letter grades**

‚â• 93 ‚Üí A, ‚â• 90 ‚Üí A-,   

‚â• 87 ‚Üí B+, ‚â• 83 ‚Üí B, ‚â• 80 ‚Üí B-,   

‚â• 77 ‚Üí C+, ‚â• 73 ‚Üí C, ‚â• 70 ‚Üí C-,   

‚â• 67 ‚Üí D+, ‚â• 63 ‚Üí D, ‚â• 60 ‚Üí D-,   

else (< 60) ‚Üí F

**Labs**

Each week there will be a lab assignment to complete during the lab
period. Labs will only be accepted before the end of the lab period,
and only when submitted from a lab workstation.

The purpose of this course is to teach the skill of computer
programming. Students need to practice writing programs themselves
without external help. Therefore, the following rules apply to
lab sessions:

* Personal electronics may not be used. If they are brought to
  lab, they must be kept in a closed container like a backpack.
* Only approved web resources can be used: Inkfish, the course site,
  provided lecture notes, the textbooks(s), the offical programming
  language documentation, and anything directly linked from the
  current lab assignment.
* Students who intentionally or repeatedly violate this policy will
  be asked to leave and will not be able to complete that lab
  assignment.
* These specific rules may be overridden by the instructions in
  individual lab assignments.

**Homework**

Each week there will be a homework assignment to be completed outside
of class.

Minimizing the use of external resources is recommended, and academic
honesty rules will be strictly enforced.

Homeworks submitted after the deadline loses 1% per hour late (round
up).

**Inkfish and Script Grades**

Labs and homework will be provided through an online web application
called Inkfish and must be submitted through the same system. Emailed
work will not be accepted unless requested beforehand.

A portion of your grade for labs and homework assignments may be
generated by an automatic grading script which runs when you submit
your work. Unless there is a clear bug ü™≥ in the script, the script
output is that portion of your grade and will not be adjusted
manually. You are being graded on getting the script to give you
points. You should review the output, make corrections, and resubmit
before the deadline if you are unhappy with the script results.

Script grades will be reduced if you submit work inconsistent with the
text or spirit of the assignment, such as hard-coding outputs that
should be calculated.

**Teams**

You may be assigned to work with a partner, in which case pair
programming is required. In assigning partners, sometimes there ends
up being a team of one or (under rare circumstances) three.

All team members are responsible for and get credit for any work
submitted as a team.

**Final Exam**

The final exam will be on paper. Be prepared to write both English and
code.

No electronics are allowed in exams.

Graded exams can be reviewed during office hours or by appointment.

**Grade Appeals**

If you think you recieved an incorrect grade, send me an email
describing why your grade is wrong and how you think it should be
corrected.

If the grade isn‚Äôt clearly wrong, I will ask you to stop by my office
hours so we can discuss the issue in more detail.

**Fair Grading Policy**

All grading in this class is subject to the university [Fair Grading Policy](https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).

**Excused Absences**

If you are unable to submit an assignment or take an exam on time due
to a circumstance covered by the university [Excused Absence Policy](https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/),
contact the professor to discuss making up the assignment. If you are
able to contact the professor before the assignment deadline or exam
date you must do so.

**Late Registration**

If you register late for the course please contact the professor to
discuss completing any missed assignments as soon as possible.

**Course Evaluations**

Course evaluations can be a valuable tool to determine how the
semester went. They‚Äôre more useful with a higher response rate.

To encourage more responses, any student who completes their course
evaluation before the start of finals week will get a 5% bonus to
their final exam grade.

Resources

[#](#resources)
==========================

Tutoring

[#](#tutoring)
------------------------

There is evening tutoring in the lab classroom. See the course website
for more details. The [PASS Office](https://www.plymouth.edu/academics/plymouth-academic-support-services)
also offers individual tutoring.

Accomodations

[#](#accomodations)
----------------------------------

Plymouth State University is committed to providing students with
documented disabilities equal access to all university programs and
facilities. If you think you have a disability requiring
accommodations, you should contact Campus Accessibility Services
(CAS), located in Speare (535-3300) to determine whether you are
eligible for such accommodations. Academic accommodations will only be
considered for students who have registered with CAS. If you have
authorized CAS to electronically deliver a Letter of Accommodations
for this course, please communicate with your instructor to review
your accommodations.

Academic Integrity

[#](#academic-integrity)
============================================

Please carefully read and be familiar with the unversity [Academic
Integrity Policy](https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).
Especially don‚Äôt do any of the things in the list of examples of
academic integrity violations. Make sure to review the penalties for
repeated offenses.

The primary subject of this class is writing small computer programs.
In order to learn that skill, you need to practice it by completing
the programming assignments by writing code yourself (or with your
team on team assignments).

The following things are obvious cheating:

* Submitting code that wasn‚Äôt written by you (or your team).
  + Two exceptions: Starter code supplied with the assignment; small
    examples in the lecture notes, textbook, or official documention.
* Sharing your soluton code with other students (except teammates).
* Looking at other solutions to this or similar problems.
* Accessing unauthorized resources in a lab or exam.

Cheating will be handled as follows:

* During an exam or lab, if you are caught cheating or acting in a
  way that appears to facilitate cheating (e.g. using unauthorized
  electronics) you will be asked to leave and will not be allowed to
  complete the assignment. In lab, you may get a warning first.
* The default penalty for cheating on any assignment is zero grade on
  that assignment.

Partner assignment are expected to be done working together. You have
at least some responsibility for any work submitted for your team.

You may not post solutions for assignments in this class publicly.
